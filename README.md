# Work-Day-Planner

For this assignment, we were asked to make a Work Day Planner using JQuery.
First we began by creating the time blocks in the HTML, linking them to our CSS already provided.
Following that, we needed to be able to input text in the text area, and be able to save this to our local storage when the save button is clicked.
The day planner also color codes the hours of the day, with the past hours being gray, present being red and future being green.
